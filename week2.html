      <h2>Overview of the week</h2>
      <p>
      <strong>19.1.</strong><br>
      Today I focused on my economics course. The course is intended to be done in Finnish, but I found out that the course material is also published in English
      which I can probably use towards my hours for this course. I will have to check with my counsellor if it's okay.
      <br>
      <strong>20.1.</strong><br>
      Today I focused on my course about databases and the SQL language. The documentation that I have used for postreSQL and SQLite are both in English, as
      well as the youtube videos I have been using to understand the structure better. A channel called 'Bro Code' makes in depth and well explained educational
      videos about different software related topics. The video material is completely free on YouTube.
      <br>
      <strong>21.1.</strong><br>
      Today I attended the second and final mandatory lecture, where we discussed the tasks from the first lecture. After driving home, I spent some time 
      polishing this website, adding some visual changes and also fixing some grammar. At 16:40, I had my first counselling session via Zoom. In the evening,
      I began reading the first unit of my economics course material in English, which focused on <em>the capitalist revolution</em>.
