      <h2>Overview of the week</h2>
      <p>
      <strong>19.1.</strong><br>
      Today I focused on my economics course. The course is intended to be done in Finnish, but I found out that the course material is also published in English
      which I can probably use towards my hours for this course. I will have to check with my counsellor if it's okay.
      <br>
      <strong>20.1.</strong><br>
      Today I focused on my course about databases and the SQL language. The documentation that I have used for postreSQL and SQLite are both in English, as
      well as the youtube videos I have been using to understand the structure better. A channel called <em>Bro Code</em> makes in depth and well explained educational
      videos about different software related topics. The video material is completely free on YouTube.
      <br>
      <strong>21.1.</strong><br>
      Today I attended the second and final mandatory lecture, where we discussed the tasks from the first lecture. After driving home, I spent some time 
      polishing this website, adding some visual changes and also fixing some grammar. At 16:40, I had my first counselling session via Zoom. In the evening,
      I began reading the first unit of my economics course material in English, which focused on <em>the capitalist revolution</em>.
      <br>
      <strong>22.1.</strong><br>
      Today I focused on data structures and algorithms. I found some excellent educational videos on YouTube, which I used to study. The channel is called 
      <em>freeCodeCamp.org</em>, and the video I watched is titled <em>Data Structures Easy to Advanced Course – Full Tutorial from a Google Engineer</em>. 
      The video covers the core concepts of data structures and algorithms. In the evening, I played some <em>World of Warcraft</em> with my friend. The new expansion's
      pre-patch was published yesterday, but I didnt have time to play it.
      <br>
      <strong>23.1.</strong><br>
      Didn't do anything remarkable today. I took a rest day from my course work.
      <br>
      <strong>24.1.</strong><br>
      Today I had a six-hour shift at work. I talked with my counselor about the possibility of using my work hours for my course, and they said I can use one hour per shift to focus on my pronunciation.
      I’ve noticed a pattern: words with a lot of the letter “r” are especially hard for me to pronounce. Thinking about what I need to say beforehand really helped me focus on my pronunciation.
      <br>
      <strong>25.1.</strong><br>
      Today I had my second and final shift of the week, which was also six hours long. I continued what I started yesterday: focusing on my pronunciation, especially on words with the letter "r". In the evening, I continued
      working through the first unit of my economics course book in English.
