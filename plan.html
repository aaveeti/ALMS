      <p>
      My plan for the course is to document what I have learned and the hours I have spent on this website.
      After completing all the mandatory tasks, I have 98 hours remaining, which I plan to use as follows:
      </p>

      <ul>
         <li>I want to read at least one book about a new programming language or computer architecture in English.</li>
         <li>I will practice programming exercises in English and write summaries of what I have learned.</li>
         <li>I will join the course groups and attend their sessions.</li>
         <li>I will socialize in English with my friends online and in real life.</li>
         <li>I will listen to English podcasts at work (when possible) and at home.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>My objectives for this website</h2>
         <ul>
	    <li><strong>Visually:</strong> I want my website to be very simple. It should be easy to read and easy to navigate around.
	    But I might still add some graphical elements, such as pictures.</li>
            <li><strong>Content:</strong> I will do daily documentations on what I've done during the day. Even if it's not directly about the ALMS course, 
            documenting about my other coursework will surely benefit me.</li>
            <li><strong>But the main objective for me</strong> is to combine two learning activities into one course. My main objective is to
            try to improve my English writing skills in everyday life as well as to deepen my understanding of building a simple website using HTML and CSS.</li>
