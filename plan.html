    <p>
    My plan for the course is to document what I have learned and the hours I have spent on this website.
    After completing all the mandatory tasks, I have 98 hours remaining, which I plan to use as follows:
    </p>

    <ul>
       <li>I want to read at least one book about a new programming language or computer architecture in English.</li>
       <li>I will practice programming exercises in English and write summaries of what I have learned.</li>
       <li>I will join the course groups and attend their sessions.</li>
       <li>I will socialize in English with my friends online and in real life.</li>
    </ul>
