      <p>
      My plan for the course is to document what I have learned and the hours I have spent on this website.
      After completing all the mandatory tasks, I have 98 hours remaining, which I plan to use as follows:
      </p>

      <ul>
	 <li>Combine my major with the course by building a website using HTML and CSS.</li>
         <li>Practice programming exercises in English (using materials from the internet such as videos and documentations) and write summaries of what I have learned.</li>
         <li>Join 1-2 support groups that are done independently in Moodle or via Zoom.</li>
         <li>Socialize in English with my friends online.</li>
         <li>Keep a consistent and 'fast' pace and try to finish on schedule.</li>
         <li>Document my daily shenanigans and academic endeavors in English.</li>
         <li>I will consume English media (including books, videogames, podcasts, etc.).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>My objectives for this website</h2>
         <ul>
	    <li><strong>Visually:</strong> I want my website to be very simple. It should be easy to read and easy to navigate.
	    But I might still add some graphical elements, such as pictures.</li>
            <li><strong>Content:</strong> I will do daily documentations on what I've done during the day. Even if it's not directly about the ALMS course, 
            documenting about my other coursework will surely benefit me.</li>
            <li><strong>But the main objective for me</strong> is to combine two learning activities into one course. My main objective is to
            try to improve my English writing skills in everyday life as well as to deepen my understanding of building a simple website using HTML and CSS.</li>
