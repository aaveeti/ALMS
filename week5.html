      <h2>Overview of the week</h2>
      <p>
      <strong>9.2.</strong><br>
      Today I focused on my economics course. First, I read through the unit in Finnish, and later in the day, I read it in English.
      In between, I finished giving peer reviews for last weeks essays in my support group.
      <br>
      <strong>10.2.</strong><br>
      Today I focused on my course about databases. I finished the last project exercises and only have nine exercises left in SQLTrainer,
      which I will try to complete before the course deadline. In the evening, I played some videogames with my friends.
      <br>
      <strong>11.2.</strong><br>
      Today I focused on the Cyber Security Base course. Also, I looked over the new ALMS support group task that was posted this week. I
      will do it on another day.
