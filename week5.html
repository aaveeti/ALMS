      <h2>Overview of the week</h2>
      <p>
      <strong>9.2.</strong><br>
      Today I focused on my economics course. First, I read through the unit in Finnish, and later in the day, I read it in English.
      In between, I finished giving peer reviews for last weeks essays in my support group.
      <br>
      <strong>10.2.</strong><br>
      Today I focused on my course about databases. I finished the last project exercises and only have nine exercises left in SQLTrainer,
      which I will try to complete before the course deadline. In the evening, I played some videogames with my friends.
      <br>
      <strong>11.2.</strong><br>
      Today I focused on the Cyber Security Base course. Also, I looked over the new ALMS support group task that was posted this week. I
      will do it on another day.
      <br>
      <strong>12.2.</strong><br>
      Today I focused on data structures and algorithms. I made really good progress with the exercises. In the evening, I did some light
      reading for the Cyber Security Base course. I didn't use any additional English materials today.
      <br>
      <strong>13.2.</strong><br>
      This week's ALMS support group task is to either develop last week's text by revising and rewriting, or alternatively, write a short
      (1 page) text about a different topic or a question relevant to your studies (+ peer reviews). I chose to write about a new topic and wrote an essay
      on cybersecurity focusing on the threat posed by the human factor. I also made an observation: my course material in Cyber Security Base
      uses cyber security (two words), while other media uses cybersecurity (one word). So I did some research and found that both are equally
      correct in terms of meaning. However, the two-word variant is more common in British English and in older texts, whereas the one-word
      variant is more common in American English. The one-word variant is also often seen as more modern, so I will probably start using
      that one more often.<br>
      <br>
      In the evening I focused on my economics course in Finnish.
      <br>
      <strong>14.2.</strong><br>
      Today I had my first shift of the week. I didn't get a chance to listen to the podcast today, but I did focus on my pronunciation. In the evening
      I focused on data structures and algorithms.
      <br>
      <strong>15.2.</strong><br>
      Today I had my second shift of the week. I listened to a new podcast called <em>Darknet Diaries</em>. It is an investigative podcast about
      true stories about cyber attacks. I listened to the episode, which covered the data breach on Vastaamo. In the evening I focused on studying C++.
      I made a mini "Rock, paper, scissors"-project with documentation that I found on the Internet, as well as implementing logic from other programming
      languages that I already know. It isn't the prettiest or the most optimal code, but it works as intended and I'm happy with it as a first project.

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
      I felt a little tired this week, but I still managed to reach the halfway point in this course.
      I discovered a new podcast that supports my current studies, and I successfully created
      my first C++ program.<br>
      <br>
      I would have liked to spend more time studying economics this week, so I will focus
      on it more next week. I also booked my second counselling session for Wednesday, and I have at least three
      shifts at work, so I will need to manage my time and energy carefully.
