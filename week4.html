      <h2>Overview of the week</h2>
      <p>
      <strong>2.2.</strong><br>
      Today I received the link to join the academic writing workspace. The first task is to post a short introduction.
      However, I felt that preparing for the exam was a priority today, so I focused on studying for my microeconomics 
      exam. Today, I only used the Finnish course material.
      <br>
      <strong>3.2.</strong><br>
      Today I focused on my course about databases. I also started an independent course: Cyber Security Base on Mooc, but because
      it is intended to be taken in English, I can't count it towards my ALMS hours.
      <br>
      <strong>4.2.</strong><br>
      Today is the day of the microeconomics exam. The exam starts at 17:00 and ends at 20:00 at the latest. I decided that I will
      focus on my ALMS work and lighter tasks today in order to allow my mind to relax somewhat before the exam.<br>
      <br>
      I started by posting a short introduction about myself and my past with academic writing. After I was done with the first task
      I moved onto the next one: writing a short (1 page) text about a topic or a question relevant to my studies. I chose the connection
      between mathematics and computer science as my subject, and more precisely why we need mathematics with computer science. After I was
      done with that I took a short break before the exam.<br>
      <br>
      The exam went fairly well, but I made some careless mistakes that cost me some points. I read the questions too hastily and didn't realize
      that I was meant to select the wrong option rather than the correct one.
      <br>
      <strong>5.2.</strong><br>
      Today I focused on data structures and algorithms. I had a really good flow while doing this week’s exercises. In the evening, I studied
      cyber security for a little while. I still need to do some peer reviews in the support group, but I will do them a bit later.
      <br>
      <strong>6.2.</strong><br>
      Today I focused on my course about databases. I am almost finished with the coursework, which will lighten my workload quite a bit. In the 
      evening I took some time away from studying and played some videogames with my friends.
      <br>
      <strong>7.2.</strong><br>
      I started the day early by beginning unit 9 of my economics course in Finnish. I managed to finish it before my shift started at 12:00.
      Today at work, I will again focus on my English pronunciation for part of the shift. I also found an interesting cyber security podcast
      called <em>Risky Business</em>. In the evening, I revised today's unit by reading it in English.
      <br>
      <strong>8.2.</strong><br>
      Today at work, I focused on my English pronunciation and also continued listening to my podcast. In the evening I focused on data structures
      and algorithms.

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
      I made some progress this week with my pronunciation, as well as with my academic and professional writing. I really enjoyed this week's tasks
      in the support group, which came as a bit of a surprise. Usually, I don't enjoy writing essays, but doing research and writing about a topic
      I'm genuinely interested in is actually really fun. I also think that listening to a podcast at work was a great addition to my course activities.<br>
      <br>
      I am very happy with my current pace in this course, and I will try to keep it up in the following weeks.
