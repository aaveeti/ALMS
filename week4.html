      <h2>Overview of the week</h2>
      <p>
      <strong>2.2.</strong><br>
      Today I received the link to join the academic writing workspace. The first task is to post a short introduction.
      However, I felt that preparing for the exam was a priority today, so I focused on studying for my microeconomics 
      exam. Today, I only used the Finnish course material.
      <br>
      <strong>3.2.</strong><br>
      Today I focused on my course about databases. I also started an independent course: Cyber Security Base on Mooc, but because
      it is intended to be taken in English, I can't count it towards my ALMS hours.
      <br>
      <strong>4.2.</strong><br>
      Today is the day of the microeconomics exam. The exam starts at 17:00 and ends at 20:00 at the latest. I decided that I will
      focus on my ALMS work and lighter tasks today in order to allow my mind to relax somewhat before the exam.<br>
      <br>
      I started by posting a short introduction about myself and my past with academic writing. After I was done with the first task
      I moved onto the next one: writing a short (1 page) text about a topic or a question relevant to my studies. I chose the connection
      between mathematics and computer science as my subject, and more precisely why we need mathematics with computer science. After I was
      done with that I took a short break before the exam.<br>
      <br>
      The exam went fairly well, but I made some careless mistakes that cost me some points. I read the questions too hastily and didn't realize
      that I was meant to select the wrong option rather than the correct one.
      <br>
      <strong>5.2.</strong><br>
      Today I focused on data structures and algorithms. I had a really good flow while doing this week’s exercises. In the evening, I studied
      cyber security for a little while. I still need to do some peer reviews in the support group, but I will do them a bit later.
