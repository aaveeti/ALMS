      <h2>Overview of the week</h2>
      <p>
      <strong>16.2.</strong><br>
      Today I focused on economics course in Finnish. In the evening I did some exercises for the data structures
      and algorithms course.
      <br>
      <strong>17.2.</strong><br>
      Today I spent the whole day studying data structures and algorithms. Because I was able to finish the course
      about databases early, I have some "extra" time to put into the more demanding courses.
      <br>
      <strong>18.2.</strong><br>
      Today I had my second counselling session via Zoom, where we discussed my progress in this course. After that I
      started tackling this week's support group task. This week's task is the same as last week's. I tried out a few topics,
      but I wasn't able to decide which to choose, so I decided to do it another day.<br>
      <br>
      In the evening I studied economics. After I was done with the unit in Finnish, I did some revision in English.
      <br>
      <strong>19.2.</strong><br>
      Today I studied data structures and algorithms. I have two exams coming up, so I will mostly focus on economics (in Finnish) and
      data structures and algorithms.
      <br>
      <strong>20.2.</strong><br>
      Today I had my first shift of the week. I didn't have a chance to listen to my podcasts, but I spent some time working
      on my pronunciation. In the evening, I decided to take a rest day from my studies.
      <br>
      <strong>21.2.</strong><br>
      Today I had my second shift of the week. Like yesterday, I didn't have a chance to listen to my podcasts, but I spent some time working
      on my pronunciation. In the evening, I studied some economics.
      <br>
      <strong>22.2.</strong><br>
      Today I had my third and final shift of the week. I didn't have a chance to listen to my podcasts, but I spent some time working
      on my pronunciation. In the evening, I studied data structures and algorithms.

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
      This week wasn't as productive for my ALMS progress, because I have to focus on my exams. I didn't have any time to listen to my podcasts
      at work, but I spent some time working on my pronunciation. During the weekend, I didn't have the time and energy to finish my ALMS support
      group task, so I will do it on monday.
