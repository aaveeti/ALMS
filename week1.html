      <h2>Overview of the week</h2>
      <p>
      <strong>14.1.</strong><br>
      This was the first day of the course. I attended the mandatory lecture and started building my website. In the evening I did some course planning
      and after that I switched from my laptop to my PC and played some video games with my friends in English. I made it my goal to speak English at
      least once a week whenever I'm gaming or in an online call, instead of using Finnish.<br>
      <strong>15.1.</strong><br>
      The Data structures and Algorithms I course started today. I mostly focused on my other coursework, but I also managed to do all of the compulsory tasks for the second session.<br>
      <strong>16.1.</strong><br>
      Today I focused on the course Introduction to Databases. In addition I did a little bit of planning on what I want to do about this website
      in regards of its looks and structure.

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
         <p>
         This first week was mainly about getting started and setting foundations for the course. I spent time attending lectures, completing the first
	 compulsory tasks, and planning my website. In addition to my course work, I also took an active step towards improving my English oral skills by
         using it during online gaming sessions, which felt pretty natural considering I have already been doing it for the majority of my life. Time management
         went fairly well this week, although juggling around 4 courses is pretty exhausting.<br>
	 <br>
	 Apart from my school work I did two shifts at work this weekend. I work at the airport which is a very international environment and where English
	 is used frequently. I have to confirm from my counsellor if I can use some of my work hours for this course. The first counselling meeting is next
         week.
