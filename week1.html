      <h2>Overview of the week</h2>
      <p>
      <strong>14.1.</strong><br>
      This was the first day of the course. I attended the mandatory lecture and started building my website.
      I also found an interesting book about computer architecture: Computer Organization and Architecture by William Stallings.
      I found it through Helka and will read it as an e-book. In the evening, I switched from my laptop to my PC and played some
      video games with my friends in English. I made it my goal to speak English at least once a week whenever I'm gaming or in
      an online call, instead of using Finnish.<br>
      <strong>15.1.</strong><br>
      The Data structures and Algorithms I course started today. I mostly focused on my other coursework, but I also managed to do all of the compulsory tasks for the second session.<br>
      <strong>16.1.</strong><br>
      Today I focused on the course Introduction to Databases. In addition I did a little bit of planning on what I want to do about this website
      in regards of its looks and structure.
