      <p>Hello world! My name is Veeti and I study computer science at the University of Helsinki.</p>

      <p>
      I will use this page mainly as a blog for my English ALMS (spring 2026)  course as well as practice for
      developing my own web page and using different web-technologies (such as HTML and CSS).
      </p>

      <p>
      At the top of the page you can find the websites navigation. There you can find all of the documentation
      I have done during the course.
