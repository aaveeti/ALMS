      <h2>Overview of the week</h2>
      <p>
      <strong>26.1.</strong><br>
      Today I focused on my economics course, studying mostly in Finnish but also spending some time with the English course material. This week, my goal is
      to finish the second unit of the English course material.
      <br>
      <strong>27.1.</strong><br>
      I had originally planned to study the course about databases, but the course page hadn't been updated with new exercises, and I had already completed
      most of the available ones. Which is why I decided to study the course on datastructures and algorithms. In the evening I took some time away from
      studying and played some videogames with my friends.
      <br>
      <strong>28.1.</strong><br>
      Today, while scrolling through ALMS blogs for inspiration, I came across one in which the writer had written a CV in English. This gave me the idea
      to do the same. Over the past month, I have been applying to various companies in hopes of securing a summer job related to my major, so writing a
      CV in English feels highly relevant for me. In addition, this allows me to focus on developing my professional writing skills, which I have previously
      discussed with my counsellor during my first counselling session. I won't probably post the CV on this website, but I might change my mind later.<br>
      <br>
      Today, I also studied some economics in Finnish, since I have my microeconomics exam next week.
