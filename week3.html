      <h2>Overview of the week</h2>
      <p>
      <strong>26.1.</strong><br>
      Today I focused on my economics course, studying mostly in Finnish but also spending some time with the English course material. This week, my goal is
      to finish the second unit of the English course material.
      <br>
      <strong>27.1.</strong><br>
      I had originally planned to study the course about databases, but the course page hadn't been updated with new exercises, and I had already completed
      most of the available ones. Which is why I decided to study the course on data structures and algorithms. In the evening I took some time away from
      studying and played some videogames with my friends.
      <br>
      <strong>28.1.</strong><br>
      Today, while scrolling through ALMS blogs for inspiration, I came across one in which the writer had written a CV in English. This gave me the idea
      to do the same. Over the past month, I have been applying to various companies in hopes of securing a summer job related to my major, so writing a
      CV in English feels highly relevant for me. In addition, this allows me to focus on developing my professional writing skills, which I have previously
      discussed with my counsellor during my first counselling session. I won't probably post the CV on this website, but I might change my mind later.<br>
      <br>
      Today, I also studied some economics in Finnish, since I have my microeconomics exam next week.
      <br>
      <strong>29.1.</strong><br>
      Today I focused on my course about data structures and algorithms. Nothing really noteworthy happened today.
      <br>
      <strong>30.1.</strong><br>
      Today, I had originally planned to study the course about databases, but the course page still hadn't been updated with new exercises. So, I decided to take
      it easy and do some light studying in data structures and algorithms. I started studying C++ independently during the winter break, but I haven't really had time
      to focus on it, because of my other studies. I decided that I will try to dedicate a little bit of time and energy every week on studying it, if I have the time 
      and energy. The video material I am using is completely in English, so I can also count it toward this course.
      <br>
      <strong>31.1.</strong><br>
     Today, I had originally planned to study economics, but the databases course page was finally updated, so I decided to do a little bit of both. I studied mostly 
      in Finnish, but I also finished the second unit of the economics course book. In the evening I started working on my databases course.
      <br>
      <strong>1.2.</strong><br>
      Today I started the day with data structures and algorithms, and in the evening I worked on databases. I didn't use any other English materials today, so I decided to 
      refresh my memory a little bit about C++ programming. I revisited some of my older coding exercises and watched some educational videos on YouTube.

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
      I didn't make as much progress this week as I would have liked. I had to prioritize my upcoming microeconomics exam and other coursework so that I wouldn't fall behind.
      Still, I managed to squeeze in as much English material as I could.<br>
      <br>
      For the next week, I will try to do more independent work with C++, and I was also thinking that I could start an e-book or something along those lines to boost my ALMS hours
      a little bit. I have also signed up for the support group “Academic Writing”, which should start next week. The support group is conducted remotely via weekly Moodle tasks. 
      I haven't received a link to join the workspace yet, but week 6 officially begins tomorrow, so I’ll just have to be patient.
